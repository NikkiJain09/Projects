PF: Traffic Redirection (Port Forwarding)
 
listen to port 8080

or we can use netstat command and will specify the specific port in this command also and will directly save that in a text file [http get; http post]...ftp also

or we can use tcpdump...as it works on network layer...so whenever request passes through that layer action can be taken up

Google Safe browser api

and to know the DNS name we can use host command

host
The host command performs DNS lookups. Give it a domain name and you’ll see the associated IP address. Give it an IP address and you’ll see the associated domain name.

host howtogeek.com
host 208.43.115.82

we will make  script for this and make it entry in the startup list of the OS..so that it automatically startups as system turns on


or we can use tcpdump....just like wireshark.....it will allow us to make filtering of packets easily



and to make all this energy efficient we can check whether internet is on or not...like there is a command for checking whether the cable is plugged in or not into a network interface.....ifplugstatus

or use ifconfig to view the status of all currently active network interfaces, including their names
