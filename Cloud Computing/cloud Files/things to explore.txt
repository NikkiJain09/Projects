------how to monitor port 80....to look for http get and post packets------


through this what exactly we can do is check for the url a user trying to access, or getting responses from a partical URL

Then we can send that URL to google user for its reliability issue.


------Check if there is a way to know what commands we entered exactly, what we did actually!!------

Like in cmd we entered the commands like: passwrd root, cd, grep...etc

So if we can find out if there is some file which stores all the commands we accessed...either through command prompt or through graphical interface, where all that stuffs is stored


Using this we can check for the various malicious activities like:

Root login several times, changing the file access permissions, even though he is not the real user of the file and also he/she is not belonging to one of the allowed members of the group list...who are allowed to change/ modify the files..
